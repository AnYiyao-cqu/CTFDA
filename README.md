PyTorch implementation for “Certainty and Transferability Guided Few-shot Open-set Cross-domain Fault Diagnosis”<br>
# Overview <br>
The proposed CTFDA consists three components: a feature extractor, a robust prototypical contrastive module and a transferability weighting domain adaptation module., as shown in Fig. 2. The deep fault feature of source and target samples is captured by the proposed feature extractor. The certainty-guided prototypical contrastive module based on samples informative importance is designed to enhance the data sensitivity with limited samples while achieving well class separation for open-set scenarios. The module infers informative importance of samples to guide method learn more effective representations. Meanwhile, correlation and uniformity principles are incorporated to alleviate prototype collapse. The transferability weighting domain adaptation module is designed to quantify the sample transferability and down-weight irrelevant samples based on the transferability. In this way, the great domain gap and negative transfer caused by asymmetrical inter-domain label spaces can be addressed.<br>
